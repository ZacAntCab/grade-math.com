            <p class="bio">I am an independant junior web developer who simply wanted to solve a problem I had and grade-math.com was the product of this urge to create something. As I am still in grade school, I, like many others, am quite obssesive over getting good grades sometimes and I wonder whether or not I'm going to be able to get the grade I want. A grade helper like this had been an idea and dream website of mine for a while before I ever started to write the first line of code. Months before I even started learnging web development, I started taking Harvard's CS50 course and created a very very rough draft of a grade helper that only worked in the terminal, using C. Soon after beggining this course, although I had enjoyed it, I started to get bored of the fundamentals it focused on and I gave up on programming for a while. After around 6-months away from coding, I decided I had wanted to pick up a more useful language than C, and I started watching some short Youtube Videos about the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The very same day I started this project and after only one week of developing and learning through Youtube videos as I went, I had completed a version of this website very similar to the one you see today. Seeing as this was my first ever official coding project I am extremely happy with how it turned out and I owe it all to all those Youtubers who make simplified videos on web development.</p>
